### LAB: Express

Dynamic API Phase 2: Continue working on a multi-day build of a dynamic API

At this momment we have products and category routes, a middleware with 4 modules: logger, timestamp, 400 nd 500 erro messages.

Our entry is in index.js, and it links to our server.js

Our middleware is logging and we are able to keep track of the request hits and they are timestamped.

Nothing is saving to mongo just yet.
