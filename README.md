# expressRouter


### LAB 08:

We added express, saving to mongo, and creating an actual saving to the DB. 

#### Phase 3 Requirements

From a business requirements standpoint, nothing changes. In this phase, we continue the transition towards making a “real” API server. Specifically, we will be migrating from in-memory data storage to using Mongo to store our data permanently, and modularizing our routes for flexibility. Through it all, we will be providing the same interface to our users. To the outside world, our API remains unchanged
